## Getting Started ðŸš€

In order to run the project, you need to get an API key first from [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/using#APIKey). After you get the API key, you need to create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following line:

```sh
API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
```

This project contains 3 flavors:

- development
- staging
- production

To run the desired flavor either use the launch configuration in VSCode/Android Studio or use the following commands:

```sh
# Development
$ flutter run --flavor development --target lib/main.dart  --dart-define APP_ENV=dev

# Staging
$ flutter run --flavor staging --target lib/main.dart --dart-define APP_ENV=stage

# Production
$ flutter run --flavor production --target lib/main.dart --dart-define APP_ENV=prod

```

_\*This project is tested on iOS and Android._
